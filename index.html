                I am a Quality Assurance tester at Futureverse with 3 years of experience in game development. I studied for a degree in Creative media production specializing in game design and development.<br>
                <br>
                I am a keen tabletop gamer playing Warhammer Age of Sigmar, DND and playing both physical and digital card games on a casual level with friends.<br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I have been exploring game design focusing on co-op multiplayer experiences, and studying the meta of the newest edition of Age Of Sigmar to understand the rationale behind changes made and reasoning for points changes.<br>

            <p>
                I made a game with two other students during an NZ game jam over two days with the theme of chain reaction. The game is a management sim in which you need to control your population of dinosaurs
                to help your tribe prosper. On this game, I was a programmer and designer handling the spreadsheet of chances for random events and tweaking the rate at which recourses changed and scaled with
                the player's population.

                FESTiMALS is a multiplayer party game similar to mario party except you play opposite each other on a single tablet. FESTIMALS had the aim of getting children and parents to play a game together.
                This was my final university project. I produced the project and did programming. I managed a team of 5 students to help produce 4 mini-games and have the game be playable on several mobile devices.<br>

                Myst-like game was the first project I took from start to finish during university. This was an exercise in replicating a game genre in unity and focusing on grey boxing to get a completed idea into a playable state as soon as possible.<br>
