                I am a Quality Assurance tester at Futureverse with 3 years of experience in game development. I studied for a degree in Creative media production specializing in game design and development.<br>
                <br>
                I am a keen tabletop gamer playing Warhammer Age of Sigmar, DND and playing both physical and digital card games on a casual level with friends.<br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I have been exploring game design focusing on co-op multiplayer experiences, and studying the meta of the newest edition of Age Of Sigmar to understand the rationale behind changes made and reasoning for points changes.<br>

                FESTiMALS is a multiplayer party game similar to mario party except you play opposite each other on a single tablet. FESTIMALS had the aim of getting children and parents to play a game together. 
                This was my final university project. I produced the project and did programming. I managed a team of 5 students to help produce 4 mini-games and have the game be playable on several mobile devices.<br>

                Flourish was developed as part of my second year of university working with the external client of Te-Papa to make a children's game for touchscreens. I was a programmer on this project as well as a meeting facilitator during out meetings with Te-Papa.<br>

                Myst-like game was the first project I took from start to finish during university. This was an exercise in replicating a game genre in unity and focusing on grey boxing to get a completed idea into a playable state as soon as possible.<br>
