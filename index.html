      <p>Hi, my name is Luke Burrough I am a 3rd-year student at Massey University
        studying Creative media production and majoring in game design and development.
         I'm an avid Programmer interested in both unreal and unity for programing and outside of programing.
       I beleve that games hold the potental to bring people together and create strong emotions not just
     through story but through strong game mechanics as well so i am focusing my work around createing games
  that foster relationships and strong emotions in the players just through the use of game mechanics</p>

      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/365531718" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>FESTiMALS is a multiplayer party game designed for tablets,this was my major project for university. I produced the project
        and did programming along side, Vasley Thompson(lead programmer), Aran Campbell-Hawker(programmer + sound design), Josh Laubscher(programmer),
        Luca Rosseels(lead artist), Stephanie Cruz(artist) and Jovanna Penn-Reina(sound design). with this project I aimed to make a game that could get
        parents and kids to play together on there digital devices and bring a more posative light to games<p>

      <h3>// Floods of lustria //</h3>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/311350332" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>The hill racer is a group project from uni. The goal of this project was to create a
        working racing game where you race against the clock. For this project I scratch built
        a water rising system that kills the player on contact with a respawn system that sets
         the water back down so that the player does not get caught in a death loop. I did
         everything coding wise besides the music<p>

      <h3>// Ai development //</h3>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/298299441" width="640" height="349" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>I am developing a enemy AI that is supposed to patrol
        and pursue players that the AI spots. It is in early development
        and only has the basic following down the stealth mechanics are next
        to be set in stone<p>

      <h3>// Mist Like Game //</h3>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/311359145" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>The mist like game was the first ever game project that I worked on indavidualy
        and finished all on my own. I did everything in the game except design the textures and make the audio
        this was one of my prefered projects as it is the first game i ever took all the way through the
        game development process<p>

      <h3>// Shadow Over Wellington //</h3>
      <img src="images/rule.jpg" alt="rules example">
      <p>I helped write the rules for and produce a board game with six other students in 2018
        I helped with idea and visual development but I took a lead in developing a rules system
        and designing a balanced and fun game to play there is a small segment of the rules on the left<p>

      <h3>// Flourish - Te Papa //</h3>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/311369529" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Florish is a game that I worked on as a seacond year in 2018 as an assistant
        programmer and bug fixer. I didnt have as big of a role as i would have liked
        but i am happy with the polishing and effort that went into it. as of mid 2019 you you will be able to find
        and play the finished version of the game at Te papa<p>
