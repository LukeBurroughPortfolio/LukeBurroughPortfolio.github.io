                I am a Quality Assurance tester at Futureverse with 3 years of experience in game development. I studied for a degree in Creative media production specializing in game design and development.<br>
                <br>
                I am a keen tabletop gamer playing Warhammer Age of Sigmar, DND and playing both physical and digital card games on a casual level with friends.<br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I have been exploring game design focusing on co-op multiplayer experiences, and studying the meta of the newest edition of Age Of Sigmar to understand the rationale behind changes made and reasoning for points changes.<br>

                I was a programmer on "We Wanted This To Be A Visual Novel", we made this game during a 2 day game jam with the theme of chain reaction. the game
                is a resource managment game where your have a population that you have to assign roles to keep your village alive. you can find and play it on my
                itch.io which is linked in the header

            <p>
                FESTiMALS is a multiplayer party game designed for tablets,this was my major project for university. I produced the project
                and did programming along side, Vasley Thompson(lead programmer), Aran Campbell-Hawker(programmer + sound design), Josh Laubscher(programmer),
                Luca Rosseels(lead artist), Stephanie Cruz(artist) and Jovanna Penn-Reina(sound design). with this project I aimed to make a game that could get
                parents and kids to play together on there digital devices and bring a more posative light to games

                Florish is a game that I worked on as a seacond year in 2018 as an assistant
                programmer and bug fixer. I didnt have as big of a role as i would have liked
                but i am happy with the polishing and effort that went into it. as of mid 2019 you you will be able to find
                and play the finished version of the game at Te papa

            <p>
                The mist like game was the first ever game project that I worked on indavidualy
                and finished all on my own. I did everything in the game except design the textures and make the audio
                this was one of my prefered projects as it is the first game i ever took all the way through the
                game development process
